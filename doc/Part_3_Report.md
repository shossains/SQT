### Exercise 2
See integration.suspension.PlayerMovementTest.java

### Exercise 3
Scenario 2.4 and 2.5 are harder to test with the default map because to make sure the player is next
a ghost requires a form of logic to be implemented. These scenarios require the game to be in a
specific state which is hard to achieve compared to the previous scenarios

### Exercise 4
See integration.suspension.PlayerMovementTest.java

### Exercise 5
Since the ghost is an AI and has it's own movement system it is very hard to control the ghost's
movements to get it in the necessary state.
